## Introduction

This project ia a modern C++ console application that simulates the digital rain effect similar to one that is seen in the Matrix movies. 
The program generates a visually dynamic stream of falling characters. It utilizes windows console API functions for cursor manipulations and text coloring.
The code in the project is structured using Object-Oriented Programming.

## Design & Test

The program is structured using classes and objects. I made a class called DigitalRain and the project is built around this class. This class contains the functions responsible for handling the movement of the characters (falling effect), controlling cursor positions, and changing text colors in the console.
The program uses vectors to store data such as the current positions (xPositions and yPositions) of characters and also for the number of characters.
